This is a note related to the "LZW Data Compression.htm" file that I downloaded the 10 May 2004
from   http://www.dogma.net/markn/articles/lzw/lzw.htm   and here given offline.

I have found an error in the text. The line

    add OLD_CODE + CHARACTER to the translation table

in figure 6 should be changed to

    add translation of OLD_CODE + CHARACTER to the translation table

otherwise the algorithm will not work properly.


Best regards,
G. Ridinò
