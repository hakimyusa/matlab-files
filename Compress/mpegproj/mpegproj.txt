## Introduction to MPEG-2<a id="intro" />

MPEG-2 is a video coding standard created by the [Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG)](http://www.chiariglione.org/mpeg/) and finalized in 1994. Now, in 2005, it is the standard format used for satellite TV, digital cable TV, DVD movies, and HDTV. In addition, MPEG-2 is a commonly used format to distribute video files on the internet.

MPEG-2 is an evolution of MPEG-1, an earlier MPEG coding standard finalized in 1991. In fact, MPEG-2 is a superset of the MPEG-1 standards in that any MPEG-2 decoder can decode an MPEG-1 video. The additions to MPEG-2, therefore, are what make it a separate standard. The major additions are:

* Support for higher resolution video

* Support for interlaced video (as used on standard definition TV (SDTV))

* Optimized for higher bit rates (typically 4 Mb/s and above, versus 1.5 Mb/s and below for MPEG-1)

* Scalability via layered encoding to support a variety of quality levels/transmission bandwidths from one coded source

These features plus the base technology of MPEG-1 make MPEG-2 very attractive for video storage and transmission. The adjustable compression level allows for a significant reduction in bit rate with a [just noticeable difference (jnd)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_noticeable_difference) in video quality *or* higher quality video for a fixed bit rate.


## MPEG-2 compression<a id="mpegcomp" />

The MPEG-2 bit stream is basically just a series of coded frames one after the other. There are headers and time stamps to help decoders align audio and scrub through the bit stream, but those details are not important to understand the basic coding techniques. What follows is a brief description of MPEG-2 compression techniques without focusing on the exact specification of the bit stream.


### Color model<a id="colormodel" />

Coding a frame in MPEG-2 format always begins by representing the original color frame in [YCbCr format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YCbCr). The Y component represents luminance, while Cb and Cr represent chrominance differences. The three components of this color model are mostly uncorrelated so this transformation is a useful first step in reducing redundant information in the frame.


### Chroma subsampling<a id="chromasub" />

Another way to reduce the amount of information to be encoded is by taking advantage of human vision characteristics. Human eyes are much more sensitive to luminance than chrominance, so it is common to subsample both chrominance channels. The most commonly used [subsampling format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrominance_format) is denoted by 4:2:0, which means that chrominance sampling is decimated by 2 in the horizontal and vertical direction. Both chrominance channels are reduced to one quarter the original data rate in this way and the net effect is for total frame data rate to be cut in half with hardly any perceptual effect on image quality.

*Note:* All subsequent discussion and the MATLAB codec assume 4:2:0 chroma subsampling.


### Block based coding<a id="block" />

MPEG-2 uses block based coding. This means that a frame is not encoded as a whole; it is divided into many independently coded blocks. A *macroblock* is 16x16 pixels and is a basic unit of MPEG-2 coding. However, each macroblock is further divided into 8x8 pixel *blocks*. This results in 6 blocks per macroblock -- 4 for luminance and 2 for chrominance (assuming 4:2:0 chroma subsampling).

These block sizes were chosen in part because small sections of a frame of natural video (not computer generated or edited) are likely to be correlated. This correlation helps the next stages of encoding work more efficiently.


### I, P, and B frames<a id="ipb" />

The next encoding step can vary from frame to frame. There are actually three possible types of frames, called I, P, and B frames. Each will be discussed separately below.


#### I frame coding<a id="iframe" />

An I frame is *intra* or *spatially* coded so that all the information necessary to reconstruct it is encoded within that frame's segment of the MPEG-2 bit stream. It is a self contained image compressed in a manner similar to a [JPEG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jpeg) image.

Each block of the frame is processed independently with an 8x8 [discrete cosine transform (DCT)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_cosine_transform). This transform generates a representation of each 8x8 block in the frequency domain instead of the spatial domain. Since, as noted above, the pixels in each block of a natural video are likely to be correlated, the resulting DCT coefficients typically consist of a few large values and many small values. The relative sizes of these coefficients represent how important each one is for reconstructing the block accurately.

The coefficients are then quantized using

                (  8 x DCT   )
    QDCT = round( ---------- )
                ( scale x Qi )

where *DCT* and *QDCT* represent the coefficient matrices before and after quantization, *scale* is used to determine quality, and *Qi* is a perceptually weighted quantization table. The default value of *Qi*,

    Qi = [ 8 16 19 22 26 27 29 34]
         [16 16 22 24 27 29 34 37]
         [19 22 26 27 29 34 34 38]
         [22 22 26 27 29 34 37 40]
         [22 26 27 29 32 35 40 48]
         [26 27 29 32 35 40 48 58]
         [26 27 29 34 38 46 56 69]
         [27 29 35 38 46 56 69 83]

weights low frequency content higher that high frequency content, mimicking the response characteristics of a human eye. The quality scalar, *scale*, can be any value from 1 to 31. If desired, MPEG-2 allows the value of *scale* to be mapped non-linearly to higher compression levels, with a maximum of 112.

This quantization process is lossy because the true floating point values of the DCT coefficients are not preserved. Instead, the quantized coefficients are just an approximation of the true coefficients and the quality of the approximation determines the quality of the frame reconstructed from this bit stream.

Next the 8x8 block of quantized coefficients is arranged into a vector by indexing the matrix in zigzag order given by

    [ 1  2  6  7 15 16 28 29]
    [ 3  5  8 14 17 27 30 43]
    [ 4  9 13 18 26 31 42 44]
    [10 12 19 25 32 41 45 54]
    [11 20 24 33 40 46 53 55]
    [21 23 34 39 47 52 56 61]
    [22 35 38 48 51 57 60 62]
    [36 37 49 50 58 59 63 64]

This ordering is approximately low frequency to high frequency for a very important reason: small blocks (8x8) of natural video are likely to contain mostly low frequency content. This ordering tends to group non-zero terms at the front of the vector and zero terms at the end. This type of distribution is beneficial to the coding that follows.

The final steps for coding an I frame are lossless with respect to the quantized DCT coefficients. For each block, the DC coefficient is differentially coded with the last block's DC term. The AC coefficients are [run-length encoded (RLE)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_coded) and then [Huffman coded](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_encoding). The result is a compact bit stream from which the quantized DCT coefficients can be reconstructed perfectly.


#### P frame coding<a id="pframe" />

A P frame is *inter* or *temporally* coded. That means it uses correlation between the current frame and a past frame to achieve compression. The MPEG-2 standard dictates that the past frame must be an I or P frame, but not a B frame.

Temporal coding is achieved using motion vectors. The basic idea is to match each macroblock in the current frame with a 16x16 pixel area in the past reference frame as closely as possible. *Closeness* here can be computed in many ways, but a simple and common measure is sum of absolute differences (SAD). The offset from the current macroblock position to the closest matching 16x16 pixel area in the reference frame is recorded as two values: horizontal and vertical motion vectors.

The search to find the best motion vectors is performed in the luminance channel only. Whatever motion vector is found then applies to all three channels of that macroblock.

There are a few common algorithms for finding motion vectors, such as:

1. Sequential search -- This is a brute force method where every possible match is tested within a given search window.

2. Logarithmic search -- Search 9 locations centered around the original macroblock, then keep repeating the search centered on the best match of the last iteration. At each iteration the search window gets smaller until the desired fidelity is reached.

3. Hierarchical search -- The macroblock and search window are decimated once or more, and searching takes place in order of lowest to highest resolution so the motion vectors can be refined at every step.

These motion vectors are a simple way to convey a lot of information, but are not always a perfect match. To give better quality reconstruction, error between the actual macroblock and the predicted macroblock is then encoded. This coding of the residual is almost exactly the same as I frame coding. In fact the only difference is that the quantization equation becomes

                (  8 x DCT   )
    QDCT = floor( ---------- )
                ( scale x Qp )

where *floor* is used in place of *round*, and *Qp* is a different weighted quantization table. The default for *Qp* is

    Qp = [16 16 16 16 16 16 16 16]
         [16 16 16 16 16 16 16 16]
         [16 16 16 16 16 16 16 16]
         [16 16 16 16 16 16 16 16]
         [16 16 16 16 16 16 16 16]
         [16 16 16 16 16 16 16 16]
         [16 16 16 16 16 16 16 16]
         [16 16 16 16 16 16 16 16]

During reconstruction, the residual is decoded and added to the motion vector predicted macroblock.


#### B frame coding<a id="bframe" />

A B frame is simply a more general version of a P frame. Motion vectors can refer not only to a past frame, but to a future frame, or both a past and future frame. Using future frames is exactly like a P frame except for referencing the future. Using past and future frames together works by averaging the predicted past macroblock with the predicted future macroblock. The residual is coded like a P frame in either case.


#### Encoded frame size<a id="framesize" />

Encoded frame size greatly depends on the quantization scale value, but the relative frame sizes demonstrate how well temporal coding can work. In general, a P frame will be 10% the size of an I frame, and a B frame will be only 2% of the size of an I frame.

### Frame sequencing<a id="frameseq" />

The ordering of I, P, and B frames is fairly flexible in MPEG-2. The first frame must always be an I frame because there is no other data for a P or B frame to reference. After that, I, P, and B frames can be mixed in any order.

Experimentation has shown that a repeating sequence such as

    I B B P B B P B B P B B

yields good quality and compression. Remember that the P frames reference the last I or P frame and the B frames reference the closest past *and* future I or P frames. Due to those requirements, the frames must be coded and transmitted out of display order. The ordering would be

    I P B B P B B P B B I B B

where the second I frame is actually from the next sequence of frames.


## MATLAB codec<a id="codec" />

For this project I implemented a MPEG-2 style codec in MATLAB. It encodes a souce movie into MPEG data for I and P frames (B frames are not implemented) and then can decode the MPEG data back into a movie. It is MPEG-2 *style* because it does not produce a MPEG-2 compliant bit stream. However, the important lossy quantization steps are reproduced faithfully so it is a valid example from which to learn about and experiment with MPEG-2 coding.


### Code stucture and features<a id="structure" />

The code for this project is organized into many functions that mostly reside within a single m-file. The top-level function performs four major steps:

1. Load the movie to encode.

* Encode the movie and return MPEG data.

* Decode the MPEG data and return the reconstructed movie.

* Save both movie versions and MPEG data to disk for later viewing and/or analysis.

This simulation is built with variables controlling much of the coding process to allow experimentation. Some of the parameters that can be easily adjusted are the choice of movie to encode, frame type pattern (ex: I P P I P P), quantization scale factor, sequential or logarithmic motion vector search, and motion vector search window size.


### Example coded movie<a id="example" />

As an example of this simulation's capabilities, I encoded and decoded 10 frames of a movie with the quality scale set to 31. For all 10 frames, the original, reconstructed, and error images are shown in the table below. These frames show only the luminance signal even though the source movie was color. Note that the error shows positive and negative error as differences from middle gray.

Middle gray reference frame (indicates no error):

### Experiments and observations<a id="experiments" />

#### Effect of the scale parameter on visual quality<a id="scale" />

For this test, I encoded the same frame as an I frame at many quality levels.

Original frame for reference:

<img src="s000_orig.png" width="352" height="288">

Results:

<table>
<tr>
<td>Scale = 1<br />
<img src="s001_recon.png" width="352" height="288"></td>
<td>Scale = 8<br />
<img src="s008_recon.png" width="352" height="288"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Scale = 16<br />
<img src="s016_recon.png" width="352" height="288"></td>
<td>Scale = 32<br />
<img src="s032_recon.png" width="352" height="288"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Scale = 64<br />
<img src="s064_recon.png" width="352" height="288"></td>
<td>Scale = 112<br />
<img src="s112_recon.png" width="352" height="288"></td>
</tr>
</table>

At the highest quality, with scale = 1, I can't see any difference between the original and reconstructed frames. With scale = 8, I can see very minor differences in smoothly shaded parts of the frame like the bus windows. As scale increases further, blocking artifacts appear due to the high frequency content getting reduce more and more. At the lowest quality, with scale = 112, there is a new and interesting effect. Besides being very blocky, the frame appears to be mostly grayscale. This occurs because the colors are not saturated enough so they are quantized to zero during encoding. Then reconstruction faithfully reproduces a block with no chrominance information.


#### Logarithmic motion vector search step size<a id="stepsize" />

When I first got the motion vector search working for P frames, I tried a logarithmic search with a beginning step size of 16. Looking at the resulting motion vectors showed that my algorithm was estimating the frame motion poorly.

My test video mostly pans to the left and has a fixed logo in the bottom right corner. My motion vectors were sometimes correct, but sometimes backwards, and sometimes even had a vertical component. See the motion vector plot below. Obviously it could be better.

Step size = 16

<img src="mv16.png" width="829" height="701">

I tried reducing the beginning step size from 16 to 8 and that simple change corrected nearly all of the motion vectors. Now I realize that a step size of 16 is too large to do matching with a 16x16 macroblock. There is no overlap between the true macroblock location and the test areas. A video panning at about 8 pixels per frame would not correlate well with any of the test areas so an error is likely. Making an error in the first step of a logarithmic search significantly decreases the chances of finding a good motion vector.

Below are the improved motion vectors for beginning step size = 8. Notice how consistent they are throughout the frame.

Step size = 8

<img src="mv08.png" width="831" height="702">

The really interesting point about this find is that a slower or faster panning video probably would not have shown this problem. It just happened that my test video panned at about 8 pixels per second, which is the worst case.


#### Reconstruction of a P frame without the residual<a id="withoutres" />

I was interested to see what kind of visual information gets encoded in the residual portion of a P frame and, conversely, how well a frame can be represented using just motion vectors. To see this, I encoded a P frame, then decoded it twice: once with the residual added, and once without.

Original frame:

<img src="p_orig.png" width="352" height="288">

<table>
<tr>
<td>Decoded with residual:<br />
<img src="p_res_on.png" width="352" height="288"></td>
<td>Decoded without residual:<br />
<img src="p_res_off.png" width="352" height="288"></td>
</tr>
</table>

The predicted frame without residual is a good match except for some very obvious blocking artifacts. For example, see the red sign above the bus or iron bars below the 'DVC' logo. This type of blocking error makes sense considering that without residual added, the frame is made up completely of 16x16 blocks from the last frame. This video, with slow and consistent panning, is probably an ideal choice for this experiment since there is little relative motion within the frame.


#### Execution time<a id="time" />

The final test I conducted was to profile my code and see how long encoding and decoding takes for different operations.

My first test was to compare I frame coding vs P frame coding (with a logarithmic motion vector search). The results are averaged over 30 frames.

<table>
<tr>
<td>Frame type</td>
<td>Encode time (sec/frame)</td>
<td>Decode time (sec/frame)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I</td>
<td>2.1</td>
<td>1.3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>P</td>
<td>1.8</td>
<td>1.3</td>
</tr>
</table>

The results were a surprise to me. Coding a P frame requires the same operations as an I frame *plus* the motion vector search. I thought the I frame coding would be much faster. The only possible explanation I can think of is that the residual error of P frames has many zeros and therefore can be processed by the DCT much faster.

Another execution time test I conducted was sequential versus logarithmic motion vector search. Again, these results were averaged over 30 frames and both methods used a maximum search window of +/- 15 pixels.

<table>
<tr>
<td>Search type</td>
<td>Encode time (sec/frame)</td>
<td>Decode time (sec/frame)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sequential</td>
<td>9.0</td>
<td>1.3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Logarithmic</td>
<td>1.8</td>
<td>1.3</td>
</tr>
</table>

Here the results make sense. The sequential search requires many more operations and therefore takes longer; about 5 times as long in this case.

As a final note on execution time, decoding time was always consistent at 1.3 frames per second. That is because decoding is always exactly the same. There are no variables in the decoding process.
